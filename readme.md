# Sveltekit an Bun Dev Container
This repo is a basic template for Sveltekit and Bun.
To initialize the dev container the vscode extension is needed.
After install you need to build the dev container and connect vscode to the new container.
As soon as the container is build and connected to vsc all that is left to do is to initialize the sveltekit project with bun.
